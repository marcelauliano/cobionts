# IlPhaBuce1 filtering of PacBio CCS reads

This is a first try to identify co-bionts PacBio HiFi reads prior to assembly.

## Producing a lavalamp plot
One of the first ideas is to plot the GC% of the reads. Lava lamp plots can show different GC content of symbiont species in the sample, for example. Bellow you find a 3D lavalamp plot for all IlPhaBuCe1 HiFi reads.
